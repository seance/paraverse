# Introduction

Welcome to Paraverse!

Paraverse is a tabletop roleplaying game system for a high-fantasy, sword and sorcery setting.

Paraverse mainly uses a 20-sided die, with occasional use of other dice, for resolving probabilistic actions and events. There are no character classes and no strict limitations on equipment.

## Core Principles

Why have yet another RPG system? The design of Paraverse's system is based on the following non-exhaustive list of principles:

- Structure gameplay to allow the players to reason about their actions in the game world
- Focus and group the character capabilities/skills to be useful in that framework
- Provide simple and sound mathematical basis for probabilistic mechanics
- Encourage viewing each probabilistic branch as a valid, meaningful storyline
- Provide suitable and consistent level of abstraction for various activities
- Progression is based only on quest objectives and is equal for the whole group
- Minimize recording of various tokens through alternative mechanics

Paraverse aims to provide a Game Master driven, dice based, easy-to-learn and intuitive system for casual tabletop roleplay gaming.

## History of the World

The world is said to have once been all but conquered by two great empires, whose arts, sciences and culture were paramount. Elves, gnomes, dwarves and men lived side by side. Yet, as with the apple that is flawless on the surface but worm-ridden in its core, so there was a darkness of greed, suspicion, envy, and fear of one another in the hearts of these empires.

As the day of the world grew ripe and as the armies and technological might of these empires waxed, so did strife between them. Small, regional conflicts and border disputes escalated into wars. Wars escalated into massacres and atrocities. As the citizens helplessly watched, one by one the lands were drenched in blood and fire, with desperate pleas for peace drowned out by frenzied yells for vengeance.

After years of war, with famine and disease rampant, both empires stood on the brink of collapse. It was at this hour, that the arch-mages and high priests of one of the empires took their initiative. A new kind of *liminal* weapon of mass destruction was devised, one that would end the war in decisive victory. It was called the *Final Weapon*.

It ended the war. It very nearly ended *all* life, as the destructive power of the weapon tore away from the control of its masters. The utter destruction of this event was later known by many names &mdash; the Cataclysm, the Scattering, and so forth. None now live that can tell for certain, but some scholars theorize that the fabric of the Material Plane was torn asunder, and destructive energies and extra-planar daemons ripped apart cities and citizens alike. What is certain is that where great cities once stood are now hollow and abandoned places with strange creatures and presences at night.

Has it been a hundred years? Two hundred? A new world slowly arose from the ashes of the old world. Yet a deadly legacy still lingers in the world. A kind of resonant, subliminal energy, known as the *Glow*, which severely affects the Elder races &mdash; elves, gnomes and dwarves &mdash; but much less so men. As such, the Age of Men is upon us.
