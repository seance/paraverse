## Races

### Men

Men are a diverse and populous race, who &mdash; despite their average racial traits &mdash; have reached a dominant position in many of the presently habitable lands.

#### Scythians

The Scythian people comprise multiple cultures from the coastal raiders of the north, the nomads of the eastern steppes to the desert tribes of the southern wastelands. Druidic and wild in nature, Scythians have heightened senses, and are somewhat lithe and tough.

#### Garrandines

The valleys and coasts are dotted by fiefdoms of a people priding in both their natural athleticism and learnedness. Through their more collectivist outlook, the Garrandines, as these people are known, have managed to rebuild much on the ruins of the old world.

### Elves

Elves are an Elder race that dominated much of the known world before Man’s ascendance. Proud and strong willed, elves have extremely keen senses and graceful dexterity. The elven race, like all the Elder races, is in terminal decline due to genetic damage caused by the Glow.

#### Gray elves

The noble Gray elves embody the elven ideals of cool intellect, grace and presence of mind. Once the ruling class of glittering cities, the Gray elves now mainly cohabit human settlements, although some islands in the boundless sea still hold their once-proud spired castles.

#### Sylvan elves

In the long years of elven ancestry, the Sylvan elves have become far estranged from their Gray elven kindred. Their isolationist society is brutally martial and values skill with the blade and the bow in combat above all else. The strongholds of these tribal elves are in the deep woods, but many of their kin are found in human lands as well.

### Dwarves

Dwarves are an Elder race as hard and unyielding as the bedrock in which they carve their fortresses. Standing slightly shorter than Men, dwarves are of a sturdy and muscular build and almost invariably wear large beards. The dwarven race, like all the Elder races, is in terminal decline due to genetic damage caused by the Glow.

#### Redbeards (Baraz-tarâg)

The Redbeard dwarf most immediately recognizable is the raucous, boisterous warrior armed to the teeth and clad in heavy armor. Redbeards revel in battle and carnage, but observe their own strict code of honor, making them a common sight in various mercenary companies. The Redbeards are no strangers to human lands, but prefer the fortresses of their Longbeard kin whenever practical.

#### Longbeards (Sigin-tarâg)

Longbeard dwarves share many of the traits of their red-bearded kin, but keep slightly cooler heads on their shoulders, well suited to the fine arts of cogitation and mercantilism. Despite this, these stout dwarves have not forgotten how to wield the axe and hammer. Their many mountainside fortresses, quarries, mines and forges dot the landscape far and wide.

### Gnomes

Gnomes are a curious and ancient Elder race, often mistaken as either young elves or dwarves due to their smaller stature. Their mischievous and humorous nature conceals exceptionally keen cognitive and empathic abilities. Surprisingly resilient and nimble, gnomes are the size of smallish, slender humans and sport a variety of facial hair styles. The gnomish race, like all the Elder races, is in terminal decline due to genetic damage caused by the Glow.

#### Tinkers

While not strictly a separate ethnic group, Tinker gnomes ascribe to a somewhat different philosophy than their Astromancer cousins. They have a mind of machinery and cogwheels, and embrace a more physically adventurous world view. Tinker gnomes are often found in dwarven smitheries and forges, but are well traveled.

#### Astromancers

Astromancer gnomes are those of their kin who have long taken a more spiritual interest in the world. Although they share the mechanical aptitude of their gnomish brethren, they are also fascinated by the deep currents of magic and the divine. These gnomes, rather uniquely, can be found among all of the other cultures &mdash; even the reclusive Sylvan elves &mdash; but also build their own settlements which mix the natural and the technological.
