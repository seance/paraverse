## Shields

Shields have a Shield Value property, which has the following functions.

- Increase Evasion against [ranged attacks](combat#ranged-attack-resolution)
- Act as extra armor against all [attack damage](combat#attack-damage)

| Shield Type | Value |
|-|-:|
| Buckler | 1 |
| Heater | 2 |
| Tower | 3 |

## Equipment Slots

A character can have at the ready the following weapons.

- Primary melee weapon
- Secondary melee weapon
- A shield, if secondary weapon is not used
- A ranged weapon, Throwing or Marksman
- A small sidearm, either melee or ranged

## Wield Limits

A character's [Wield](characters#secondary-stats) secondary stat value indicates how many points worth that charcter can wield weapons.

For melee and ranged weapons, the base damage value is also the wield point cost of that weapon. For shields, the shield value is its cost.

Weapons and shields share the same pool of points.

It is possible to wield more points than your Wield stat up to `3` points, but for each point in excess, a `-1` skill modifier is applied.

For one-handed weapons and ranged weapons, for every `3` unused wield points, gain `+1` skill modifier, up to `+3`.

## Armor

Armor has a Armor Value property, which reduces incoming [damage](combat#attack-damage). Armor also has a Armor Weight Class property, which indicates how restrictive the armor is.

| Example armor | Value | Weight Class |
|-|-:|-|
| Hardened cloth | 1 | Light |
| Hardened leather  | 2 | Light |
| Studded leather | 3 | Light |
| Rawhide | 4 | Medium |
| Chainmail | 5 | Medium |
| Scale mail | 6 | Medium |
| Heavy chainmail | 7 | Heavy |
| Splint mail | 8 | Heavy |
| Plate mail | 9 | Heavy |

### Armor Weight Classes

*Light armor* does not restrict the user.

*Medium armor* has the following restrictions.

- *Physical* skills cap at `+8`
- *Stealth* skills cap at `+8`

*Heavy armor* has the following restrictions.

- *Physical* skills cap at `+4`
- *Stealth* skills cap at `+4`
- Awareness caps at `+2`
- Magic caps `TODO`

A skill cap means that the *effective value* of a skill is limited while wearing armor, although the actual skill value is unchanged.

## Durability and Disrepair

In addition to other properties, each piece of equipment (weapons, shields, armor) has a *durability* property.

This property describes the fundamental state of that piece.

At the end of every bout of combat, at the Game Master's discretion, *disrepair* checks are performed for each weapon, shield and armor that was used in that combat.

Usage can be judged as follows.

- A weapon was used in a skirmish or ranged attack
- A shield was used in a skirmish or to deflect ranged attack
- Armor was worn in a skirmish or as target of a ranged attack

A piece of equipment that is in disrepair has the following modifiers.

- Weapons' base damage is reduced by `2`, to a minimum of zero
- Armor's armor value is reduced by `2`, to a minimum of zero

Equipment in disrepair can be restored via a [Field repair](characters#list-of-skills) skill check. See [rest](time-and-space#rest) and [camp](time-and-space#camp).

### Disrepair Resolution

To check whether a piece of equipment becomes in *disrepair*, roll a `d20`. If the roll value is *greater than* the *durability* of the piece of equipment, it becomes in disrepair.

A piece of equipment that becomes in disrepair has its durability value reduced by `1` permanently.

When it reaches zero, that piece of equipment becomes unusable and broken beyond repair.

### Field Repair Resolution

A piece of equipment in disrepair can be restored to full functionality using the [Field repair](characters#list-of-skills) skill during a [rest](time-and-space#rest) or [camp](time-and-space#camp).

Repairing a piece does not restore its lost durability &mdash; this effect is permanent.

The target difficulty for repairing a single piece of equipment is its current durability value, to a minimum of `10`.

## Equipment Special Traits

In addition to normal equipment traits, there are also special traits that reflect unusual craftsmanship or magical or divine enhancement.

### Elven Equipment

Elven equipment is uncannily light but no less durable.

- Elven weapons have a [wield point cost](#wield-limits) of one less than their base damage.
- Elven Medium armor counts as Light armor for [restrictiveness](#armor-weight-classes)

### Dwarven Equipment

Dwarven equipment is exceptionally durable.

- For Dwarven equipment, durability checks are performed twice. The equipment becomes in disrepair only, if it fails both checks.

### Gnomish Equipment

Gnomish equipment is ingeniously constructed.

- Gnomish weapons trigger [Critical hits](combat#critical-hit) on both `19` and `20`
- Gnomish Heavy armor counts as Medium armor for [restrictiveness](#armor-weight-classes)

### Enchanted Equipment

Enchanted equipment is enhanced by magical or divine means.

Enchanted weapons and armor can have skill modifiers or other effects. Some monsters can have resistance to corporeal (unenchanted) attacks.
